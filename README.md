Atlantic bluefin tuna larvae growth and fitness

This repository contains all files needed to run the model presented in the paper by Fiksen & Reglero (ms). The source code 'FiguresforPaper.py' generates a number of plots and .svg - files that together form the basis of the manuscript. The model is explained in detail in the Supplementary to the file. The code needs several data-files (.txt) to run, and these are also available here.
